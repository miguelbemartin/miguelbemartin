### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I am a Software Engineer based in Zurich, Switzerland. Originally from the sunny south of Spain, Andalusia.

More than 7 years working remotely, I do enjoy building effective remote teams that work happily and productively together. Creating a workspace where people keep growing, work on interesting challenges, feel a real impact on what they are building and being rewarded for it.

Right now, I am working as Technical Lead at HubSpot. We are building a suite of products, an inbound marketing, sales and CRM software platform. We help companies of all sizes grow better, by transforming the way they attract, engage and delight customers. As Technical lead, my responsibilities are a combination of managing people and working on the technical side. I believe in the importance of creating software that solves real problems, building solutions that can easily scale in an efficient way.

Feel free to reach out to me.
