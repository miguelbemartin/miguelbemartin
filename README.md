### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Writing code since 2010 and working remotely since 2013. Here, I talk about Software Engineering, AI Engineering, Management and Leadership, and also my personal learnings through my experience that I think can be useful to others.

Currently, I am working as an Engineering Lead at HubSpot in the AI Platform Group. We are building an AI Platform for allowing product teams build easily on top of that. We provide an AI Agents Platform, RAG as a service, evaluation framework and a few other solutions in the space.

In my spare time, I am organizing The Engineering Book Club, an online community of professionals who enjoy reading engineering books together.
