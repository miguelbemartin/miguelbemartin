### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal website. I am a Software Engineer based in Germany. Originally from the sunny south of Spain, Andalusia.
Writing code since 2010 and working remotely since 2013, I talk about Software Engineering, Management, and Leadership.

Currently, I am working as a Technical Lead at HubSpot. HubSpot is the world's leading inbound marketing, sales and CRM software platform.

In my spare time, I am organizing The Engineering Book Club, an online community of professionals who enjoy reading engineering books together.
